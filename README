README for PrattParserInC

These files illustrate an elegant parsing method, implemented in C, first
described by Vaughn Pratt in his 1973 paper, "Top Down Operator Precedence."

They are part of a larger project, and so may not compile standalone at the moment.
These files are here to illustrate the technique, and give examples of
my code.
