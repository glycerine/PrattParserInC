README for PrattParserInC

These files illustrate an elegant parsing method, implemented in C, first
described by Vaughn Pratt in his 1973 paper, "Top Down Operator Precedence."

Pratt's description was in Lisp, and so hard for most people to interpret. Douglas
Crockford's description in Javascript (see Beautiful Code, and 
http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html) were instrumental in bringing 
this method to my attention. 

They are part of a larger project, and so may not compile standalone at the moment.
These files are here to illustrate the technique, and give examples of
my code.
